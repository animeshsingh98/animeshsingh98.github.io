**1) Planning & Control of full‑sized vehicle - GEM e4 :**
---
This is my course project of CS 588.  The goal was to integrate different sub-systems of a full-fledged autonomous system in GEM e4
vehicle. I was part of the planning team and developed and deployed an efficient algorithm for avoiding pedestrians in real time on ROS framework.
In the theoretical part of the course, I implemented probabilistic & graph based planning algorithms with trajectory optimization and obstacle avoidance for Dubins Car.

**2) Vision Based Automated Inspection System:**
---
Manufacturing is a domain where we need an experienced human to read the 2D CAD of a part and setup the inspection. We developed an algorithm that can help in 
streamlining this process. The vision based automated inspection utilized feature matching algorithm, leading to a 60% reduction in chip manufacturing setup cost.
We filed a patent for the novel vision‑based automation framework that will enable seamless integration of design, manufacturing, and metrology.

**3) Manipulator ‑ Controls and Simulation :**
---
Derived & implemented optimized trajectory planning algorithms and control techniques on CRS Robotic Manipulator with TMS320F28335
DSP controller using C to perform precise tasks in limited time (Task demonstration).
Developed forward & inverse kinematics, equation of motion, various controllers including joint‑space controller, inverse dynamics controller,
task‑space controller, impedance controller, and hybrid‑contact dynamics for CRS Robot.

**4) Obstacle Avoidance with Segway :**
---
Developed control system for a self‑balancing segway robot with sensor fusion of infrared sensors deployed on Texas Instrument C2000 micro‑
controller using C to detect and avoid obstacles using position PI controller
Statemachine approach was developed for having different functionalities like navigation mode & wall following mode for smart maneuvering.

**5) Autonomous Drone Team - Rakshak :**
---
Designed and deployed aerial image-processing algorithms, optimizing camera parameters for precise drone-based mapping.
Developed CNN-based object detection, enabling real-time human and object localization in mission-critical environments.
Implemented autonomous drone navigation, integrating Pixhawk and ROS for intelligent mission execution.

---
**6) CycleGAN :**
---
Used CycleGAN to deploy a application that can change the weather in a photo according to our inputs.
