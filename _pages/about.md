This is Animesh Singhâ€™s home on the web!
I am a Master of Science student at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign(UIUC) with speacialization in Robotics. Completed my Bachelors from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in Mechanical Engineering. My first programming experience started in grade 6 when my father brought a PC. 
I have experience as a software engineer at Jaguar Land Rover and have worked on development and deployment of robotics platforms.
Have real-world experience on software architecture and embedded hardware programming.

A full-stack engineer
======
I take pride in my diverse experience across sensors, algorithms, software development, software architecture, design and analysis of mechanical structures as well as exposure to hardware platforms and theie simulations and emulations.

My Interests
======
1. I like exploring and working on exciting fields. I would always be the first person in the team to contribute to a new project.
2. Not an advocator of pure reinforcement learning methods on robotics. But I advocate the integration of classical and modern techniques to get the best solution. 
3. Always ready to help the team and debug issues in any field.

Future
------
I would love to be a part of a startup working on real-world applications using cutting-edge research in various fields towards the development and advancement of Robotics.
